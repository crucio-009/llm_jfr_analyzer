# LLM JFR Analyzer — Improvements & Future Roadmap

This file enumerates potential enhancements and architectural improvements for the LLM JFR Analyzer project, considering robustness, feature set, extensibility, and user experience.

---

## 1. Feature and Usability Enhancements

- **Advanced Visualization**
  - Integrate charts/graphs for GC pauses, thread states, allocation rates, etc. in reports and web UI.
- **Multi-file Upload**
  - Support batch analysis of multiple JFRs for comparative diagnostics.
- **Session Timeline Navigation**
  - Allow time-sliced or interactive exploration of long-running JFRs in the UI.
- **Downloadable Raw JSON**
  - Option to download extracted/intermediate event data for offline/manual study.
- **Custom LLM Prompting**
  - Expose advanced prompt engineering settings ("system message," verbosity, etc.) in UI and CLI.
- **Local/Remote Model Registry**
  - Let users register their own HuggingFace models in a config file/selector.
- **Model Benchmarking**
  - Add an accuracy/performance benchmark for new LLMs using standard test JFRs.

## 2. Robustness and Error Handling

- **Graceful Handling for LLM Outages/Failures**
  - Show actionable error messages if models/API fail to load or download.
- **Fallback for `jfr print` or `disassemble` Errors**
  - Provide custom error views/pages and actionable suggestions.
- **Timeouts and Progress Feedback**
  - Add progress indicators for large file processing or slow LLM calls.
- **Resource Limits and Temp File Cleanup**
  - Manage disk use on chunked/parallel JFR analysis; auto-clean stale files.

---

## 3. JFR & JVM Event Handling

- **Richer JFR Event Extraction**
  - Add support for more event types: memory allocation, lock contention, JVM flags, etc.
- **Event Filtering**
  - Let user select event types/categories to focus report.
- **Profile/Report Comparison**
  - Add GUI/CLI report diff — regression detection across two or more profiles.
- **Pattern/Risk Library**
  - Built-in hardcoded rules for common JVM anti-patterns and performance gotchas.

---

## 4. Testing and CI

- **Many Real JFR Samples & Output Baseline**
  - Build out a non-personal test set for regression testing and golden outputs.
- **Mock LLM for Testing**
  - Test pipeline logic independently of OpenAI/HF/model availability and cost.
- **Continuous Integration**
  - GitHub Actions or other CI pipeline to ensure all tests pass on PR/push.

---

## 5. Security, Privacy, and UX

- **Result Redaction**
  - Option to scramble, redact, or pseudonymize thread/class names, SQL, etc. in the report.
- **User Authentication**
  - Login/API key support for deployment in teams.
- **Usage Quotas**
  - Rate limiting for public server deployments.
- **Accessibility Improvements**
  - Add ARIA, improve label/contrast for all web UI elements.

---

## 6. Extensibility and Advanced Architecture

- **Plugin/Extension Framework**
  - Interface for new event types, report analyzers, or LLM adapters.
- **REST API**
  - Batch automation/CI endpoints for remote JFR uploads or large-scale analysis.
- **Containerized Deployment**
  - Publish Dockerfile, example compose/k8s for server deployment.
- **Configurable Defaults**
  - Move size/model/UI preferences into a YAML/TOML config.

---

## 7. Documentation, Community, and Growth

- **User Guide with Screenshots**
  - Extended docs explaining all options and advanced analysis.
- **Developer Guide**
  - Contributing workflow for new models or plugins.
- **Changelog and Semantic Versioning**
  - Easy tracking of breaking changes, features, and fixes.
